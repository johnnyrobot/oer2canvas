/**
 * Deterministic alt-text QUALITY checks (WCAG 1.1.1).
 *
 * Why this exists: axe only checks that an `alt` attribute is *present*. It
 * cannot tell `alt="Bar chart of enrollment rising each quarter"` from
 * `alt="SPEED BUMP.jpg"`. Neither can WAVE. So an image with a junk alt passes
 * every automated checker on the market while conveying nothing to a screen
 * reader — and, until now, would have passed this app's gate too.
 *
 * That gap is not theoretical. Run against 8 real Canvas course exports (314
 * pages), these rules found 10 alt failures that axe scored as clean, including
 * `SPEED BUMP.jpg` and `giotto_ Chapel.jpg` (art-103), `DigitalLiteracy2.jpg`
 * (digital-literacy-2016), and `ios-icon.png` — in a course whose own title is
 * "english-102-ACCESSIBLE-template".
 *
 * It also closes a hole in the remediation loop: `describe_image` lets the model
 * *draft* alt text, and the gate's re-audit only ever verified that alt was
 * present. A model that emits a filename or a placeholder was trusted. Now the
 * draft is checked by a rule instead — which is what makes it safe to run the
 * remediation loop on a small on-device model at all.
 *
 * Rules only fire on things a machine can be *sure* about. Severity encodes that
 * confidence: `error` withholds the passed-checks badge (definite 1.1.1
 * failure), `warning` is surfaced but does not, `alert` routes to human review.
 * Judging whether a plausible-sounding description is *accurate* is not
 * decidable here and is deliberately out of scope.
