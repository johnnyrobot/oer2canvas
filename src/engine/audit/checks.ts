/**
 * The accessibility check registry (ADR-0003).
 *
 * Adding a deterministic check used to mean editing seven files, because
 * `auditor.ts` hardcoded one numbered pass per rule. Checks are registered
 * HERE, in one list, and the auditor iterates it.
 *
 * Two rules make that cheap:
 *
 *  1. **A check receives the whole `ScanResult`.** No per-check declaration of
 *     which page data it wants, and no plumbing to add when it wants more —
 *     that machinery was rejected as sized for a rule count that doesn't exist.
 *  2. **Fields added to `ScanResult` for a new check are OPTIONAL.** That is
 *     what keeps every existing check and every fake fixture compiling when the
 *     next check needs data nobody collects yet. The rule is applied
 *     retroactively: `ScanResult.images` is optional too, rather than being
 *     grandfathered in as the one permanent exception.
 *
 * What a registry does NOT remove: the browser-side extraction script, when a
 * check needs page data the runner doesn't gather yet. The win is roughly four
 * of the seven files, not seven.
